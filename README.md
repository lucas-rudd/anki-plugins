Anki Plugins
============

This repository contains personal Anki add-ons and helper scripts.

### Contents

- `sync-anki-addons.sh`: Convenience script for syncing add-on folders into Anki's `addons21` directory on macOS.
- `tag_to_deck_sort/`: An add-on that automatically moves cards into specific decks based on their tags (originally written for JLPT-tagged notes).

### Usage

- Treat each subdirectory as a separate Anki add-on.
- Copy the desired add-on folder(s) into your Anki `addons21` directory, or use `sync-anki-addons.sh` if you have it wired up for your local environment.
